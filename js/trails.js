The trail then continues all the way to the top of the mountain with a breathtaking view that will give you a chance to explore the Devils Knuckles, a mountain edge that divides Nelshoogte and the Barberton Basin. It has similar views to Kaapsche Hoop with views over the Barberton valley, a vertical drop of up to 500m on most knuckles. The trail also offers two separate dams for those interested in bass fishing, with an option of passing a beautiful waterfall and a natural pool to cool down in. A short climb will bring you back to the Queens Base Camp where you can enjoy a nice braai before leaving for home or stay over for a night in the tranquil settings of our Queens Base Camp",
